This programming assignment is to implement an abstract data type.
You can choose any data type that you are interested in, choose an 
appropriate representation for it, and define and implement some 
operations on the data. Some examples of data types are given below, 
but you are free to choose your own.

The main purpose of the exercise is to illustrate the idea of an 
abstract data type, such that a user can manipulate variables of 
that type, without knowing the implementation of the type. Your 
implementation does not have to be very efficient, nor does it have 
to support a large number of operations. You should define 
sufficiently many operations so that the type can be used effectively.

Some suggested data types: (But you can choose your own!)

1. Arbitrary precision integers.  2. Rational numbers  
3. Arbitrarily specified precision real numbers.
4. Single or multivariable polynomials 5. Matrices and vectors 
6. Boolean functions 7. Polygons and other geometrical objects. 
8. A RLC Electrical circuit. 9. A Boolean circuit. 
10. A dictionary, that is, a set of character strings.
